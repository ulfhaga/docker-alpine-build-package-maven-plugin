To modify system network connections without the root password: add your user account to the 'plugdev' group, or use Polkit.

To use iwd instead of the default wpa_supplicant install iwd, start its service and add the following to your /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf:

[device]
wifi.backend=iwd
